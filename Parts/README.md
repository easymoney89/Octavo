Contains a library of Verilog modules to implement all kinds of functions.
The code is optimized for speed on FPGAs.

If you are adding to this library, your code must be Verilator-clean.
The verilinter script will do the checking for you, and automatically look-up any needed sub-modules in the Parts library.
