It is unknown if Quartus correctly infers that these memories are all addressed in contiguous and non-overlapping ways, and so condenses them into fewer MLABs. Especially given that many of the AOM/BTM entries are mapped along a single memory word.\n\nAlso, Quartus may be using MLABs more finely (per ALM, rather than per LAB), making space optimizations in the source moot.\n\nSolving #46 may also moot this issue, as it will remove the big muxes, and reduce all these simultaneously addressed memories into single ones addressed by the LSBs of the Address.\n"

    "body": "Related: #56 \n\nIf we add a bit mask to the offset of the AOM, we could do DSP-like circular buffers in power-of-two sizes (and alignments? tied to pointer base address?). Cheap, but a little inflexible.\n\nAlternatively, we can add a counter and a second Programmed Increment (PI): after N-1 accesses with increment I, the Nth access uses another increment J, which could be negative. \nIf J == I, then we have arbitrary circular buffers, of size limited by the counter.\nIf J == I-1, then we have a sliding window (e.g. for FIR filters)\n\nMax cost: one 10/12 bit counter, and double the number of 10/12 bit PI entries.\nWe would have to store the extra PI as a separate memory fetched in parallel, one of which selected by a flag set by the counter before getting added to PO. Based on the improve Controller (fig 5.6, pg. 94 in thesis), a mux before the PO+PI adder, in the same pipeline stage, _might_ be fast enough.\n\nNote: this **strongly** interacts with #46, which would remove the multiplexers from the AOM design, and shorten them the one stage needed to fit them after pipeline stage 1. \n"

The P&R time will also remain shorter. As we pack more SIMD lanes into SWAR lanes, the area and speed benefits should increase.\n\nSWAR suggests bit packing/unpacking ops (see Hacker's Delight) to convert between packed bytes (as in 32-bit words) and SWAR words, and to manipulate the guard bits.\n"

In effect, extending I/O handshaking with a co-routine instead of a no-op.\n\nThis co-routine (a stored PC in the I/O Handshaking module?) could also emulate some of the work recovery aimed-at by thread re-scheduling on I/O latency events, which we strictly disallow in Octavo to maintain determinacy.\n"

    "body": "Now that, with the BTM, the Controller uses the result of the previous thread instruction instead of the value of operand A, the Datapath is no longer coupled to the Controlpath in a feed-forward manner.\n\nThus, we should be able to slide the Datapath down towards the end of the Controlpath, increasing the number of stages between the I and A/B memories, which means more stages for the AOM, BTM, and any other control hardware.\n\nThis has a potential major effect: being able to slide the AOM down past stage 1 means we can use the instruction operand addresses directly to read from the PO/PI AOM memories, eliminating the slow multiplexers in the AOM, which should improve speed and scalability.\n\nThe constraints are that the read from the next thread instruction in the pipeline cannot arrive to A/B earlier than the write of the current thread instruction. At most, they must coincide so the write-forwarding logic around the A/B BRAMs feeds the write to the read. Same for the read of the next thread instruction from the I memory: we don't want to introduce a second cycle of delay.\n\nWe must also be careful about the feeding of the ALU output back to the BTM, to make sure the thread numbers line up (i.e.: ALU output from thread N must reach the BTM stage containing the next instruction from the same thread).\n"

    "body": "Based off https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/690631/cuda-programming-and-performance/so-whats-new-about-maxwell-/post/4194866/#4194866\n\nImplement a Look-Up Table instruction(s) to optimize boolean logic. \nLoad a table with 4 bits representing the 2-LUT Truth Table for 2 bits, one from A and B read data. four 4-bit entries per table, times 8 threads, equals 32 entries, meaning 2 32x2 MLABs used completely. Memory-map per-thread entries in a single word: 4*4  = 16 bits. Writing to word updates all 4 entries.\n\nPlace table in ALU, replacing Logic Unit:\nALU0: read LUT Memories\nALU1: register MLAB output, as always.\nALU2: drive 4:1 muxes, one per output bit, selected by A and B bit, maps perfectly to 6-LUT hardware (Cyclone V and Stratix IV)\nALU3: replace final mux with 4:1 mux: Logic, Add/Sub, MHI, MLO\nWill need careful experimentation to preserve Fmax, but shouldn't be hard.\n\nNote: first investigate combining Add/Sub with Logic operation, as per Warren's \"Hacker's Delight\".\n\nUse first 4 opcodes as index into 4 entries, giving programmable, universal 2-term boolean logic opcodes. Easy to default to XOR/AND/OR/NOT. By default, all zero entries encode to a result of 0, regardless of A/B inputs, preserving NOP and address 0 operation.\n\nBenefits: reduces all 2-term boolean operations to a single instruction. \n\nBest case: unoptimized logic (e.g.: ~(~A \\* ~B)), reduces 4 operations to 1, but that could be trivially optimized to A + B beforehand. DeMorgan's Law also guarantees that any operation with 2 negations can be converted to one with 1 negation.\n\nCommon case: operations with a single negation (e.g.: ~A \\* B), reduces from 2 to 1 operation. Basically all negations vanish, reducing any compound boolean sequence with N terms to the best sequential case of N-1 operations.\n\nSee: http://iie.fing.edu.uy/investigacion/grupos/microele//iberchip/pdf/75.pdf (\"Classifying n-input boolean functions\", Correia and Reis) for characterization of all 16 possible 2-term boolean functions.\n\nSee: bit-manipulation papers/thesis by Yedidya Hilewitz, Princeton PALMS group, now at Intel.\n\nWould be much more powerful with 3 terms, as in CUDA 6.0, but that would require adding a C memory to fetch alongside A/B, which is an icky architectural change.\n"
