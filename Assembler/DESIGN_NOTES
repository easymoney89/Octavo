Design Notes for Octavo Assembler.
----------------------------------

Rough syntax:
If first word is not an opcode, or a code-generating command, then it's a branch or read/write label.
Then pass remainder of line back to line parser.

All names must be globally unique. Names are labels applied to variables, pointers, ports, or instructions.
An absent name has no value (None), and is not included in any name search.

Private variables are always named, and so writable. They can only be looked up by name.
Each thread may have a separate instance of the same private variable, holding different data under the same name.
These multiple instances will all resolve to the same address in the code, and be generated at the same relative location in each thread where they are defined.

Shared variables exist as a single copy, identically addressed, by all threads.
If unnamed, they are constants (since they cannot be written to) and referenced by value only (named variables are ignored on lookup), and other references to the same value get pointed to the first such instance.
If named, they are variables (since they are writable) and referenced by name only (ignored on value lookup).
Unnamed shared variables cannot refer to named shared variables and vice-versa.

Variables hold either no value (None), an integer (Int), or a list of values where each item is an integer.
A variable name refers to the first element of a list.
Lists eventually get resolved to a sequence of integers in memory.
The memory bank of a variable is inferred from the first instruction read operand which accesses it.
If a variable is only written to, then the memory bank inference is arbitrary (usually allocated into the least-full bank).

Pointers are like shared variables but multi-threaded values (unique to each thread, but at same address), always named, and also referred by name only.
Pointers point to a named variable.
The memory bank of a pointer is inferred to be the same as that of the pointed-to variable.
Pointers are dual, with both read and write entries.

Ports are like pointers, with the memory bank pre-specified instead of inferred (since anything wired to it pre-exists any instruction).

Instruction addresses are all zero-based. The Octavo CPU adds the per-thread default offset (for private variables) to these at runtime.
Instruction read operands can be names or literal values.
Names will be resolved to the address of the named variable, pointer, or port.
Literal values will be resolved to the address of the unnamed shared variable holding that value.
Instruction write operands are always names, which refer to variables, pointers, or ports.
Literals are allowed in instruction write operands, but only to support writing to address zero as a NOP.
A literal value will be taken as a (zero-offset) address, and isn't recommended as it may corrupt state in this or other threads.
(cross-thread communication will be solved later, if not through named shared variables.)

----

The assembly process goes through 5 high-level phases:

1. Parsing the source
2. Allocating code and data
3. Resolving the references in the code/data to integers (addresses and values)
4. Generation of the binary values to control the hardware
5. Output to memory initialization files

Names and other references go through the follwing sequence of value types as they are resolved:

0. None (no value assigned, usually right after Parsing)
1. String (at Allocation)
2. Integer (at Resolution)
3. Binary pattern (at Generation)

TODO

Split pointers into read and write cases, which will fit better with resolving read and write operands and avoid the "Write before read" problem.
Need code and data de-allocation words to allow loading code/data at runtime.
Pointers must be manually unloaded to free an indirect memory location.
There needs also drop_branch and drop_pointers to free up the used branch detector and indirect memory entries.
